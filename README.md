## 🌊 About Jal Setu
Jal Setu is a decentralized water conservation and management platform that integrates *Ethereum-based gamification* to encourage community participation. It allows users to track, contribute, and be rewarded for their efforts in water conservation through blockchain-based rewards.

## 🚀 Features
### 🌍 *Water Conservation Tracking*
- Users can log their water-saving activities.
- Community-based challenges and leaderboards.

### 🎮 *Ethereum-Based Gamification*
- Earn Ethereum-based rewards for completing conservation tasks.
- Smart contract-based transparency in reward distribution.
- Secure transactions using blockchain technology.

### 🏆 *NFT & Token-Based Rewards*
- Users receive *NFT badges* for achieving milestones.
- Earn in-app tokens that can be redeemed for real-world benefits.

### 📱 *Flutter-Based Mobile App*
- Intuitive UI for tracking progress.
- Secure login with Firebase authentication.
- Real-time updates on conservation efforts.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- *Frontend:* Flutter
- *Backend:* Firebase
- *Blockchain:* Ethereum (Smart Contracts using Solidity)
- *Storage:* IPFS (for NFT metadata)
- *APIs:* Web3.js for Ethereum interaction

## 📜 How It Works
1. *User Registration*: Sign up using Firebase authentication.
2. *Task Completion*: Users complete water conservation tasks.
3. *Smart Contract Execution*: Ethereum smart contracts validate actions.
4. *Rewards Distribution*: Users receive ETH-based tokens or NFTs.
5. *Leaderboard & Progress*: Users compete and level up based on their contributions.

## 🔗 Blockchain & Ethereum Integration
- Uses *Solidity* to implement smart contracts for fair reward distribution.
- Implements *Web3.js* for interacting with Ethereum blockchain.
- NFT rewards stored on *IPFS* for transparency and security.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK
